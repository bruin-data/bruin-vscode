# Bruin
Bruin is a unified analytics platform that enables data professionals to work end-to-end for their data pipelines. This extension is built to improve the development experience of data products on Bruin using Visual Studio Code.


## Features

- **Syntax Coloring**: Applies YAML syntax coloring to Bruin code in SQL files (enclosed between `/* @bruin ... @bruin */`) and Python files (enclosed between `""" @bruin ... @bruin """`).

- **Folding Range Provider**: Allows folding and unfolding Bruin code regions in SQL and Python files for a cleaner workspace. 

- **Auto Folding**: You can configure this setting by editing your through the Settings UI under Extensions > Bruin.

*Important Note*
	The Pylance extension, which provides advanced language support for Python, may affect the expected behavior of the auto-folding feature. If you encounter inconsistencies with code regions not folding as expected in python files, please review your Pylance settings. Adjusting these settings or temporarily disabling Pylance may help to resolve these issues. 


- **Dynamic SQL Content Viewer**: Renders SQL content within a VS Code Webview, enabling content copying, and automatically refreshing on file updates.

## Usage

- **Syntax Coloring**: Enclose Bruin code with delimiters:
	- In **SQL files** `/* @bruin` and `@bruin */`.
	- In **Python files** `""" @bruin` and `@bruin """`.

	2. Click the rocket icon ðŸš€ in the top right menu.
	3. A Webview will open, previewing the SQL content.
	4. Click the "Copy" icon to copy the content.
	5. The theme color of the view can match the vscode current theme (dark/light/Dark high contrast)
	6. The SQL Preview automatically responds to changes in checkboxes and dates, ensuring an immediate re-render.
	
**SQL Validation and Execution**:
    - **Validation**: Click the "Validate" button to validate the current SQL. A custom notification will appear based on the validation results.
    - **Run with Flags**: Click the "Run" button to execute the SQL command in an integrated terminal. This can include optional flags based on user input (checkboxes & date inputs).
        - **Start and End Dates**: 
			1. Select start and end dates using the date picker inputs to specify the time range for the run command.
			2. An "Exclusive End Date" checkbox is available. When checked, the end date is adjusted to the precise end of the selected day (`23:59:59.999999999`).
			3. The dates will be appended as flags directly to the Bruin run command
